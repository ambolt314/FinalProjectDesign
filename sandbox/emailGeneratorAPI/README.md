## 10th April

I have moved to a new project
My reasoning for this is that I want to create an end-to-end
proof of concept

My starting point is to create a Spring MVC:

I'm following the guidance set out in the instructions given
in the link above

Study day. Working to get this proof-of-concept complete.
Managed to get the Maven issues that I was having fixed.
I switched from Maven wrapper to Maven Bundle

Got a server exception when retrieving the email data.
Hopefully, this will fix it:

That worked! :+1:

Might be good to design some kind of "Thank you" page so that there's not just a blank space
