managed to get some help from ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/share/d565811d-13a4-43de-b034-93909be83485

did not know about java.awt, which was good
had to modify code to make it more effective

my current approach is to use a text file to store the email body.
Then, I can read the contents of the file and use formatting to add information

Thinking about improvements to be made.
This is going to be an iterative process.

What I am thinking now is that I should work on getting html formatted email bodies...?
That way, I can present some nice UKRI-branded rendering in future
